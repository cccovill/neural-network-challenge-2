 For the part of this module that instructs one to create two variables for both the department and attrition columns, I received assistance from Enzo Zirotti, as I didn't really 
 understand this.  

 ### Installation procedure (for local PC install):
    
        From github, download "attrition.ipynb"
        Using Jupyter Notebook - open "attrition.ipynb"
        From within Jupyter Notebook - select "Run All'


### Installation procedure (for Google CoLab Install):  (Note: This was developed and tested on Colab)

        From github, download "attrition.ipynb"
        Navigate to Google Drive and click the button labelled "+ New".  A pop-up window should appear.... 
        From the pop-up window, select "File Upload". Another "File Upload" window should appear.... 
        From "File Upload" window, navigate to and select the "attrition.ipynb" file
        Once upload is complete, right click on the the menu (verticle elipsis) to the far right on the entry for the file.    A pop-up appears from which you need to select "Open With", and then select "Google Colaboratory".
        From within Google Colaboratory, select "Runtime" from the upper left menu, and then select "Run all"
