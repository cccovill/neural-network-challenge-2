This was a good question, as it made me do some digging.  Off the top, I didn't remember this being discussed much.  What I found is that this data is considered unbalanced.  That is, the attrition \"target\" column has a 16 vs 84 percent split across the values of YES and NO respectively. It is considered unbalanced because the minority class (value=YES in this case), is less than 20% of the data.  Rule of thumb is % being less than 10-20% is considered unbalanced (in this case 16%).  The minority class for department is even worse.  The HR department represents only 4% of that column data. Therefore, to specifically answer the question, \"accuracy\" is NOT a good metric to use with this data.\n","\n","References are in my readme for these quotes.....\n","\n","\"Accuracy is a helpful metric when you deal with balanced classes and care about the overall model “correctness” and not the ability to predict a specific class.\"\n","\n","How do you know if the dataset is balanced or unbalanced?\n","Consider the threshold: There is no fixed threshold that defines when data becomes imbalanced. However, a common rule of thumb is that if the minority class represents less than 10–20% of the total samples, the data is often considered imbalanced. Domain knowledge: Consider the context and domain-specific expectations.Mar 28, 2024\n","\n","\n","\n","2. I used the two activation functions of sigmoid and softmax for the attr_output and dept_output layers respectively.  I used sigmoid on attrition because it is a single binary value (YES or NO: 1 or 0), and this is what sigmoid is best used for.  Conversely, I used softmax on the department column, because softmax is best used on categorical values and department had three catagories.\n","\n","\n","3. One approach to improve the results would be to select different columns for X.  That is, select ones that may have more correlation to the target columns. I selected columns that had many unique characteristics, and this may have lead to the lower results.  \n","Another approach I would take,  would be to improve the inbalance of the department column by using SMOTE (and perhaps other methods too). Synthetic minority oversampling, or SMOTE, I do recall be discussed.  It is used to increase the sampling data of the minority class, to bring the dataset into a better balance.\n","Finally, after trying SMOTE, I'd check into using other sampling techniques to improve upon the imbalance of the column.  A couple discussed were RU (random-under sampling) and RO (random-oveer sampling).
